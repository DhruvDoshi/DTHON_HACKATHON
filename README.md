## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Development of the crypto coin which could also work as the medium of the information transfer.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Developed a ERC-20 Backed Solidity contracts on Remix Engine over the Ethereum Architecture

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Works only with the Ethereum contracts
- Specifically designed to work with the ETH gas fees.
- Can not scale further after the contractis executed.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

in this hackathon we started the development of the blockchain based cryptocurrency which could escalate in the further works

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Well,frankly this contract won't help a lot if youa re looking to clone this as this was made for the specific use case and would not help in developing any other use case.

Anyways if you need run the solidity file on the remix engine and you would be good to go.

See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Install Solidity engien in the local computer and the global access to the remix engine to execuite the command on the ethereum network.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/DhruvDoshi/DTHON_HACKATHON/
```

And run on the remix ethereum



## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

make your own crypto currency!
